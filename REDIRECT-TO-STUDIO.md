# Home Page Redirect to Studio ✅

## What Changed

### Before
When users opened the Shopify app, they saw a **welcome screen** with:
- Welcome message
- "Open Virtual Try-On Studio" button
- Feature cards (Fast Generation, High Quality, etc.)
- Shop connection info

### After
When users open the Shopify app, they are **automatically redirected** to the **Studio page** with the 4-step workflow:
1. Upload clothing photos
2. Choose AI model
3. Select poses
4. Generate & confirm

## Files Modified

### `app/routes/app._index.tsx`
**Changed from**: Full welcome page with Polaris components  
**Changed to**: Simple redirect to `/app/studio`

```tsx
import { redirect, type LoaderFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";
import { authenticate } from "../shopify.server";

export const loader = async ({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  await authenticate.admin(request);
  
  // Redirect directly to studio page
  return redirect("/app/studio");
};

export default function Index() {
  // This component will never render due to the redirect
  return null;
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Old Flow:
1. Open Shopify App
2. See Welcome Screen
3. Click "Open Virtual Try-On Studio" button
4. Navigate to Studio page

### New Flow:
1. Open Shopify App
2. **Instantly see Studio page** (Step 1: Upload)
3. Start working immediately

## Benefits

✅ **Faster workflow** - Users get to the studio immediately  
✅ **Less clicks** - No intermediate welcome screen  
✅ **Better UX** - Direct access to core functionality  
✅ **Matches main app** - Same immediate studio access as your main Trayve app

## Backup

If you ever want to restore the welcome screen, the old code is preserved in Git history.

To restore:
```bash
git log --all --full-history -- app/routes/app._index.tsx
git checkout <commit-hash> -- app/routes/app._index.tsx
```

## Testing

1. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the Shopify app
3. You should see the Studio page immediately (Step 1: Upload Clothing)
